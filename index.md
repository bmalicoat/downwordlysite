**How do I play Multiplayer?**

Make sure you have enabled GameCenter in your iOS Settings.

**Isn't this a word?**

It might be! Downwordly uses a dictionary similar to other word games and doesn't allow proper names and some other words you may find in a dictionary. If you think you found a word that should be accepted but isn't, let me know!
